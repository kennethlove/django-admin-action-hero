action\_hero package
====================

The ``action_hero`` package is made up of two main sub-packages: ``actions`` and
``lib``. The ``actions`` sub-package contains various action implementations
that can be used in your projects or as inspiration. The ``lib`` sub-package
provides an abstract base class and types to help you create your own custom
actions.
